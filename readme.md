# Notes from Faust

(Project is ongoing, the use of past tenses saves me time on rewriting)

This is a client done during my time as a contract developer for Digitide systems technologies, and I've decided to share some of the development process and a part of the final product. I believe this will help junior developers at understanding, in my opinion, the most usual processes of quickly developing an MVP from client specification, design, and finally development.

As there was no technical specifications from the client for the project, the technical officer directed I use the LAMP stack.

Largely, this is a CRUD application. But I will be using the MVC framework, and utilizing payment processing APIs. I will not be using any PHP frameworks, nor any frontend framework or libraries.

I have attached relevant documents and images, and any other useful materials.

UI design for the project was done is Figma.
